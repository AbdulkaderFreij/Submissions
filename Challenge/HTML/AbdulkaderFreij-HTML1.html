<h1>What is Arduino Uno?</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Arduino Uno</strong> is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328
  (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins
  <small>(of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs)</small>, 6 analog inputs, a 16
  MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a
  reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller;
  simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC
  adapter or battery to get started.
</p>
<h2>How the Arduino Uno is Powered?</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Arduino Uno</strong> can be powered via the USB connection or with an
  external power supply. The power source is selected automatically. External
  (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or
  battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug
  into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd
  and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector. The board can operate on an
  external supply of 6 to 20 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the
  5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. If using
  more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The
  recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.

<h3><em>Communication</em></h3>
<p>
  The <strong><em>Arduino Uno</em></strong> has a number of facilities for
  communicating with a computer, another Arduino, or other microcontrollers. The
  ATmega328 provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication, which is available on
  digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX).<br />
  An ATmega16U2 on the board channels this serial communication over USB and
  appears as a virtual com port to software on the computer. <br />The '16U2
  firmware uses the standard USB COM drivers, and no external driver is needed.
  However, on Windows, a .inf file is required.<br />
  The Arduino software includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual
  data to be sent to and from the Arduino board. <br />The RX and TX LEDs on the
  board will flash when data is being transmitted via the USB-to-serial chip and
  USB connection to the computer (but not for serial communication on pins 0 and
  1).<br />
  A SoftwareSerial library allows for serial communication on any of the Uno's
  digital pins. The ATmega328 also supports I2C (TWI) and SPI communication. The
  Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the I2C bus; see
  the documentation for details. For SPI communication, use the SPI library.
